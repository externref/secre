## Running locally

The program requires nodejs (17.x+) and python (3.9+) installed in order to run the code.

If you are on a linux environment you can run [`setup.sh`](./setup.sh) for requirements setup.

To run the code use :
```sh
$secre_api # to run the API

$npx ts-node src/index.ts # to run the bot
``` 

in different terminals

# commands

i'll add later
